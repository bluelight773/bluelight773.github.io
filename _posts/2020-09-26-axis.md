# Understanding the axis parameter in numpy

For newcomers to numpy and other data-science-related libraries, the numpy parameter can be a source of confusion. It may often appear to do something other than what one may intuitively expect. This blog is an attempt to demystify what it means and how to use it.

## sum, mean, max, min, argmax, argmin

The axis parameter works in a similar fashion when it comes to many common methods, such as sum, mean, max, min, argmax, and argmin. Our focus here will be on
sum, but what is stated regarding sum applies to the other methods mentioned here.

Let's start by forming 2x3 numpy array.

~~~python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6]])
~~~

Now, let's attempt to apply the sum method. We'll note that this could be done in any of the following ways.
~~~python
a.sum(0)
a.sum(axis=0)
np.sum(a, 0)
np.sum(a, axis=0)
~~~
